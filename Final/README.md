1. Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

I learned so much about web development in this class, especially since I had no prior experience. I learned many aspects of HTML and CSS, and was able to confidently write and create in both formats by the end of the class. I am a lot more comfortable using things like GitHub and understanding the structure of web pages and file storage.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?

I learned a fair bit about web design. I understood a lot of digital media principles before this class (file types, file sizes, file displays, color, typography, etc.), but I learned very useful ways to implement that prior knowledge into my own web pages.

3. Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.

Just like Creative Coding, this class was taken as an elective and was a huge step out of my comfort zone as a photographer and filmmaker. I am both proud of the work I've accomplished in this class and happy that I decided to take this class. I have already found myself noticing little quirks and aspects of web pages I visit, and it is so cool to know why something isn't displaying properly or how a web designer did what they did on a certain page. I am also excited to take what I've learned here and utilize it in my Squarespace site for my photo business. It will be neat to add a touch of my own personality and take a bit of ownership over the design of my own site. Who knows, in the future maybe I won't even use a web template like Squarespace and will run my business from my own self built website!
