1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

System fonts are fonts that are system specific- i.e. they are installed locally on your device and are often used in printing or offline word processing.
Web fonts are fonts custom fonts hosted by an outside server. They are not locally stored, and need certain elements to display them in an online fashion.
Web-safe fonts are fonts that website creators can be reasonably confident will be available in the end user's local system/device. These include the basics like Times New Roman, Arial, etc. 

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

Having fallback fonts gives you as the creator the option to try and keep your sites fonts as close as possible to your vision. If you don't have a fallback font and the users server/browser/whatever fails to load your desired font and instead uses a default font, then that user will not have the same stylized experience that you wanted them to have. You are basically giving up a last chance to customize your end user's experience if you neglect to add fallback fonts.

3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you
did to overcome them.

I had a pretty difficult time understanding this week's work and completing this weeks assignment. After several passes through the class website, I think I have a good grasp of the theoretical nature of fonts and how to use them. However, I was unsuccessful in my many attempts to utilize self-hosted fonts, so the fonts on my page are just the basic fallback fonts that I had to resort to since I couldn't make my fonts load on the browser. I mentioned this in an email to Michael, and hopefully I will have figured this out before my final website.
