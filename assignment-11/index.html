        What the Heart of the Young Man Said to the Psalmist
        <br>
        Tell me not, in mournful numbers, <br>
        "Life is but an empty dream!"<br>
        For the soul is dead that slumbers,<br>
        And things are not what they seem.<br>
        <br>
        Life is real! Life is earnest!<br>
        And the grave is not its goal;<br>
        "Dust thou art, to dust returnest,"<br>
        Was not spoken of the soul.<br>
        <br>
        Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br>
        Is our destined end or way;<br>
        But to act, that each to-morrow<br>
        Finds us farther than to-day.<br>
        <br>
        Art is long, and Time is fleeting,<br>
        And our hearts, though stout and brave,<br>
        Still, like muffled drums, are beating<br>
        Funeral marches to the grave.<br>
        <br>
        In the world's broad field of battle,<br>
        In the bivouac of Life,<br>
        Be not like dumb, driven cattle!<br>
        Be a hero in the strife!<br>
        <br>
        Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!<br>
        Let the dead Past bury its dead!<br>
        Act,--act in the living Present!<br>
        Heart within, and God o'erhead!<br>
        <br>
        Lives of great men all remind us<br>
        We can make our lives sublime,<br>
        And, departing, leave behind us<br>
        Footprints on the sands of time;<br>
        <br>
        Footprints, that perhaps another,<br>
        Sailing o'er life's solemn main,<br>
        A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,<br>
        Seeing, shall take heart again.<br>
        <br>
        Let us, then, be up and doing,<br>
        With a heart for any fate;<br>
        Still achieving, still pursuing<br>
        Learn to labor and to wait.<br>
