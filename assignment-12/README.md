1. What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

  Padding is the amount of space between the content of an element and the outside edge of the element itself. If the element has a border, padding can be used to separate the content, often text, from the border in order to increase legibility. Padding can also be used to make "empty" elements display. You could use it to make a colored box appear on screen.
  Margin is the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element. Use this to create separation or style between multiple elements or to adjust how close/far an element sits from the edge of the screen.
  Borders are the outlined edge around a box/element. They are more of a style tool as opposed to a space management tool. They can be colored and stylized to match the theme of a page.

2. Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.

  I didn't have any major challenges this week. I used my new knowledge to revamp a previous project and had a lot of fun doing it. This week's content was very straightforward and easy to implement.
