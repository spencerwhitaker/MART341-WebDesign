1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

  A few aspects here and there were "recap" for me, but the majority was brand new. It was challenging to learn (or at least the introduction we were given, I'm sure there's many semester long classes to be had on HTML before one can reach any sort of mastery). I do think it was a fun challenge. I am a very visual learner, and being able to see my mistakes or progress in almost real-time while learning was so beneficial to my experience.

2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

  I am so very excited to get into CSS. I have never been exposed to it, and I am very interested in learning a new concept/language. I don't know enough about CSS to be excited about a particular aspect of it, I am just excited to take my web pages a step further so they look more professional and modern and less like the clunky websites I grew up with. I want to create smooth, intuitive, beautiful web pages that I feel proud of sharing and that visitors enjoy the experience of interacting with.


3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes.  What did you do to overcome your challenges?

  For this assignment, my biggest issue was the same I always have - remembering the tags for the elements I want to use and how to use them correctly. I feel like I have a very solid grasp of the conceptual world of html. For every assignment I get I could describe right off the bat what elements I will need and how they will be ordered. It all makes sense in my head, my issues only exist when trying to actually type everything out.
