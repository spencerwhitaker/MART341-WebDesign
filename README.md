Repository for MART 341 Homework
Week 1: Introduction
Week 2: Learned about files, directories, documentation, plain text editors and files, scripts, naming conventions, VCS, and how GitHub operates. Did some research to refresh my knowledge on the internet and its operation. I feel very good about this week, I understood the content clearly and was able to follow the coursework without issue. I am at a good starting point for moving forward with my learning.
