1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do
they serve?

I've come across many forms while browsing the web - I actually have had various iterations of a "Contact Me" submission form on my personal website. It was super interesting to see the behind the scenes work on how those forms operate and how to customize them.

2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage.

A text input could be a simple log in page, with a username/password. A selection could be on one of our multiple choice online quizzes. Button input is often used at the end of a form as a trigger to tell the page that the user is done editing their information and the information is ready to be submitted, like a "place your order" button after checking out on an Amazon purchase

3. My workflow was pretty similar to last week, I went step by step through the homework requirements and step by step built my page from the top down. I had a much easier time recalling the correct elements and tags needed and only needed to check my work against a previous weeks example twice.
