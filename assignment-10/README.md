1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal selectors are indicated by a * and apply their styles to every part of the document. This is useful when making widespread changes you want applied to everything, such as a font family or font color.
Element selectors are used to select all elements of a certain type such as "h2" or "p." This is useful when you are trying to change how each page heading looks or if you wanted to add a background to all the paragraphs within a page.
Class selectors are used to select all elements that contain the same "class." Using the class property to label different elements allows you to select those elements in your CSS. For example, maybe you want all the paragraphs that talk about fish to have a blue background and all the elements that talk about plants to have a green background.
ID selector types are used to link a style to a very specific element that you identify with their individual ID value. Maybe your third div element in your page is supposed to be a scrolling list of houses on your airbnb webpage. You can use the ID selector to specify changes to only that individual element with its "airbnb-list" ID property value.

2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.

To pick my colors, I opened the image of the suburban postcard in photoshop and used the eye dropper tool to find the exact color values for certain pixels within that image. I wanted to have a yellow, blue, and pink palette, and I found a light, medium, and dark shade of each color to provide some variety and depth to my final project.

Yellow - Light: #fdd768 Medium: #eec712 Dark: #cd9a1b
Blue - Light: #548dde Medium: #2071ca Dark: #212586
Pink - Light: #eb5b96 Medium: #d95183 Dark: #ca3972

3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.

I had a bit of an issue with setting the position of an element, as the only instructions I could find were setting the position of an element in relation to a canvas. I tried several times to make a canvas that would sit behind the rest of my page, but I couldn't seem to make the canvas fit the dimensions that I wanted it to. In the end, I just made a text element with my name and positioned it to the top left and a bit removed from the border.
