1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these
elements different, or what role do they play?

  Each page can only have one of each. The head element provides information for users and computers alike to figure out what is on the page, who wrote it, etc. The body element provides the content that the user came to the page to find.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

  Structural markup is the nuts and bolts of the document. It contains information such as what type of element something is (i.e. head, body, line break, etc.).

  Semantic markup is used to give meaning to an otherwise unemotional text. This can be through emphasizing words with italics or bold, or delineating a quote or citation to further explain a word.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  I'm not quite sure what "work cycle" means, but I basically went through the homework instructions step-by-step and then tried to write the code without referring to the website. I would check my work by opening my index.html document in my browser after each step. If I messed up on a tag or other step, I would then refer to the course website to find out what went wrong.
