1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Divs are page-wide "blocks" that one can fill with tags and content but can change the attributes for on a large scale. Classes are attributes within a tag that can link several different elements in order to enact a change or style on all of them in the same class. Ids act as an identification tag so you can find certain elements quickly. Spans are inline elements that act similar to divs in the way they are used to structure elements,

2. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or
Vimeo to host your videos?

The advantages for me come in all the control the user will have over the embedded video and the fact that the websites take care of the coding process for you, you simply have to copy and paste. However, the big disadvantage is that your page is now reliant on another page. The video could be deleted or copyrighted or any number of things and that could affect your site without you even realizing it.

3. Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you
overcome them?

I did not have any huge challenges this week. I had some issues getting my multiple source video to display, but I realized I had been linking the poster and sources incorrectly and worked it out. I also played with different preload sequences to experience each from the page's visitor's POV.
